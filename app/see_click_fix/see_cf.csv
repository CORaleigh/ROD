There are some issues with this design that need to be revealed.  At the intersection of Town and Country a median has been planned that is going to make the right turn off of Millbrook dangerous because of the sharp angle of the turn and because of the natural gas pipes that are above ground at this intersection just off the right on Town and Country.  On the other end of Town and Country there is presently a turn lane for people turning left into the apartments that the city is going to eliminate entirely with a median.  This will, on the first day, cause traffic to back up onto Lead Mine road.  There is also a plan to install an around about where Kingsley intersects Town and Country.  For the folks living on Town and Country who requested this, I predict you will all want this removed within 30 days because of problems you will have accessing your property.  The speed limit is already 30 and the city cannot lower the speed any further due to traffic volume so it seems to me the city is attempting to disregard the law by installing traffic calming devices.

When turning onto Sagehurst from Falls River Avenue, one has to make a sharp right turn to avoid hitting the car.  If one is pulling up to the stop sign, they cannot see a possible pedestrian.  Also if pulling out of Sagehurst, one will have to use the middle of the road to stop at the stop sign, thereby, not allowing another car to turn onto the street.  All these people need to do is park the car in their double garage or double driveway, or even on the other side of their driveway.  It would keep their car away from the stop sign.  This issue was posted before.  It seemed the owners complied for a while, but the car is back posing an obstruction.  It seems very unsafe and inconsiderate of them to monopolize the road so close to the stop sign when there are other options.

156,1458829,Traffic Speed Issue Unresolved and Speed Monitoring Sign Removed ,"Pineview Drive, a neighborhood road, is being used as a through-way which is causing an increased number of accidents and crime in the area.  There is a 90 degree curve on Pineview Drive and drivers DO NOT obey the 15 MPH posted signs.  There have been several accidents at this curve (mailboxes taken out, cars deep in homeowner's yards, etc.).  The issue has been posted numerous times on this site and the issue has not yet been addressed.  I am reposting in the hopes that the City can help protect the neighobors of Pineview Drive.  It is important to note that this road has 0 sidewalks and several children walk this road to Athens High School every day.  Very dangerous!

At one point, the City placed speed monitoring signs at the beginning of the 90 degree curve. These signs, however, were removed within a few days and no other action was taken.  The problem remains.

The 15-MPH cautionary signs that were put up have done nothing to curb the speeders at the sharp corner on Pineview. 

Could the city please consider one of the following: 
1) Park a police car on the street to ticket speeders, several of us are happy to volunteer our driveways 
2) Setup a permanent sign that flashes the violator's speed next to the recommended speed 
3) Go back to having Pineview Drive as a dead-end where it meets Swift Drive (Note, this eliminates another issue reported presently on the site). 

We have too many walkers on their way to Lake Johnson and too many students on their way to Athens Drive High School to compromise on safety. This road is too narrow. It was never meant for thru-traffic. 

We have submitted this issue three times to the city. Please help us. As neighbors and parents we have met and decided that without resolution will consider submitting this issue to Diane Wilson, the WRAL Troubleshooter.

245,1408626,Traffic Calming,"I live on the 1800 block of White Oak Road in the Five Points neighborhood and we are in desperate need of some form of speed control. 

This block is a one way street. Cars park all up and down both sides for the street. The people that park on the street are both residents of the block, and visitors to the popular area and of the church. When cars are parked on both sides of the road (all the time), it turns into a single lane road. The problem is that cars FLY down this street and there is no room to swerve or avoid anything that may step out into the road or car doors opening. 

Cars fly down this road and if a child or animal were to step out from between parked cars, it would be a tragic and potentially fatal accident. What is worse is even if the driver did see someone stepping out into the road and swerved to miss them, there is nowhere to go to avoid hitting them. Many people walk down this street to get to the 5 points area and all of the restaurants and shops so there is heavy foot traffic.

Cars have clipped my car taking off the side mirror, and you have to take your own life in your hands when getting out of the car that a speeding car does not take off your door. 

This is a narrow street that is occupied by many families with small children and pets. 

It is my understanding that the street was made one way on this block to reduce through traffic but many if not most people using this road do not live on it. This is a straight and down hill street which already makes it easy to gain speed, but people fly going well over 40 MPH and it is dangerous in such a narrow space. Someone is going to get seriously hurt.

350,1476522,After Hours / Critical Issues,"Driving down Currituck road yesterday I noticed road markings for what appears to be traffic calming devices.  What is strikingly obvious to me is that this is about to become the most dangerous road in North Hills.  Placing obstacles in the road, especially on a hill, is going to cost someone their life.  Similar traffic calming devices are in place on Reedy Creek road just off of Edwards Mill road.  Where the center islands exists, drivers are running off the road and into the grass.  The ruts are clearly visible.
The petition process for this, as with the petitions for other traffic calming projects, was not done in the best interest of the citizens in the neighborhoods.  The petition signatures have been suspect, people on adjoining streets were not notified of the meetings, and there is no record of signatures of people opposed to the project.  Further, there is no evidence of a speeding problem.  The city placed a counter on Currituck for a 24 hour period and determined from that a speeding problem existed.  The real issue all over Raleigh is not speeding, but rather increased traffic because of the growth of the city.  One of the problems with forcing people to drive slower is it gives them more opportunity to send text messages or check email.  Both are much more dangerous than driving five miles per hour over the speed limit.
The city has hired people to run this traffic calming program and they have to find something to do and this is the result.  I am very annoyed in the continued waste of my tax dollars on this program.  I am also frustrated to no end that the city council refuses to acknowledge the opposition to this program.

I see at least 3 to 4 drivers in a 5 day period every week run the red light at the intersection at Edwards Mill Rd and the on ramp to Wade Avenue. 

The lights turn green at different times and due to driver inattention drivers are running the red lights. There have been many near miss accidents at these intersections. 

For example, if you are heading north on Edwards Mill and you are at the stop light at Edwards Mill and East Wade Avenue, the light at the next intersection at West Wade Avenue will turn green.

I also noticed that the signal for making a left going west off of hillsborough does not have the same issue and is a protected left on green light and doesn't seem to be causing any issues. This signal is no more then a 100 feet from the other signal in question.

Making this a flashing yellow light vs. a solid red should be sufficient. It is not that significant of an unprotected left turn since the visibility is so good. I have experienced a lot more left turns where it is worse than this one - for example, turning onto dilliard drive or athens drive off of tryon - both use flashing yellow lights to keep the traffic flowing.

It washes out anything on the curb like trashcans or yard waste. The water flows so intensely that trashcans are often washed down the street and slam into cars parked. The sidewalk becomes completely washed away.

it does not take much water at all to result in a river running down the right side of the street/sidewalk. This issue needs to be addressed. 

The issue is causing there to be erosion on my retaining wall that hold my property up.

993,1339121,Signals / Signs,"People turning left have two choices: left lane or right lane. The right lane ends almost immediately into a parking lot, so people end up doing last minute lane shifts. Others use that right-hand lane to pass the left-hand lane traffic and then try to squeeze in. In either case, people merging from that right-hand lane into the left-hand lane slow down the traffic, causing people at the end of the line to miss the light. From the patterns I have observed in the mornings, it would appear that blocking off one of the turn lanes at this intersection would make traffic flow much more efficiently.

The Street Cleaners in the red shirts were doing a fine job getting it all tidied up for another day in Raleigh--these folks are to be commended for cleaning up the disgusting leavings generated by nightlife that needs to be more carefully regulated by the Raleigh City Council, the Downtown Raleigh Alliance, and the Raleigh Police. 

The problem is not the people cleaning the streets. The problem are city leaders who put up with allowing Fayetteville Street to become such a cesspool of side effects.

The mess being cleaned up are the side effects of too many clubs in too small an area over-serving people to the point where vomit and broken bottles are rather common in the morning...as is the crazy amount of noise late at night which many of us do not even bother reporting any longer due to ineffective responses. 

Cleaning up the mess is appreciated
--we salute you red shirted street cleaners. 

We don't appreciate public officials who let the root causes which produce this mess continue.

During evening rush hour (5pm-5:30pm), the green light lasts a very long time for traffic coming off of Dan Allen on campus - so long that no cars are left on Dan Allen since traffic there is lighter, relatively. Unfortunately, the domino effect of this is that traffic completely backs up down Western Boulevard to the light at the intersection of Western and Avent Ferry/Morrill Drive. So the issue is that left turners from Avent Ferry pull out into the intersection, have nowhere to go because the light at Dan Allen is red for Western Blvd for so long, and those left turners completely block the intersection for a whole cycle of green lights from the Morrill Drive traffic exiting NC State. For the third day in a row now, I have seen this traffic pattern completely jam up the intersection so that no one or only one or two cars can exit Morrill drive. It never used to do this, so I'm wondering if some cycling between the Dan Allen light and the Avent Ferry light has recently been adjusted, causing the new conflict.

Seems like the in bound and out bound of the city traffic on the cross streets is getting a longer light, even if they are not very backed-up.

I think this is creating very bad situations, with people being left in intersections during light changes or harder to get out of the MLK/Blount St. Red light camera, because you are stuck in the intersection or traffic is not progressing to get through the intersection in a timely manner...this then makes people stop short on a yellow lights to avoid getting a ticket and can cause rear collisions.

With all due respect, I call BS. 

Here it is almost 2am on a work night, and there's a party going on in front of my house! With cops! In cars! Flying up and down the road. Screeching tires! Flashing lights! Whooping and hollering (ok, maybe not so much whooping and hollering but my point is)

ITS. TWO. AM. ON. A. WORK. NIGHT. PEOPLE!!! I cant sleep. I mean, I *could* sleep but.... I go to sleep and the Indy 500 starts in my front yard. As I pointed out to the very nice female officer whom I approached whilst seated beside Six Forks Rd, ITS TWO AM ON A WORK NIGHT, can't you move your operation 100 yards up the road to the corner of Cranbrook? There's a wider spot in the road! You can get people on radar quicker! You can see further up the road! There are no houses near there were you are going to ADVERSELY AFFECT SOMEONES SLEEP!! Her curt and polite answer was ""Oh, well we like this spot, it's our favorite, we've always used it"" Really? I mean, hold on. REALLY?
You wanna catch speeders you say, Capt RL Munn? Well then why don't you get your race team out here each and every morning from 7am to, oh, 9am and run a Florida Speed Trap with an officer on the side of the road running radar and 10 cars behind him, primed and ready to pounce. Lets never mind the fact that it'll snarl traffic so severely someone might actually complain, but you say basically I will be woken (or is that awoke?) each and every night your officers so dictate that they park in their ""favorite spot"" because you know, its for the 'greater good'. If the 'greater good' is getting speeders to slow down as the are approaching Carroll Middle School (as a member of the Capital Police pointed out to me) then shouldn't your teams be out en force at an later hour instead of 2am?

The stop at 401 Oberlin Road appears to be without sign, which will discourage new riders from choosing this as an initial point of engagement with the CAT system and -- arguably -- causes confusion to existing riders as to whether passenger amenities are available to all patrons or -- at certain locales -- only to an exclusive group of invitees.  

The exiting stop, 8-9 meters north of the intersection of Oberlin and Stafford is a pedestrian death waiting to happen.

I sincerely invite you to ask the driver of coach 1284, Outbound 12 Method about the measures she TRIED to take to warn a passenger who had just disembarked that a vehicle was turning west onto Stafford from the Southbound center lane of Oberlin in front of the coach and wholly without regard to pedestrian traffic crossing Stafford.

This is NOT an irregular occurrence and – in fact – will become less infrequent as the 401 building becomes more completely occupied.

I appreciate that the current stop on Oberlin is convenient for workers and patrons (including many seniors) wishing to visit the McDonald's on Oberlin Road and Cameron, but – on balance – I think the physical welfare and even lives of the few folks who disembark and trod south on the Oberlin sidewalk trumps the imposition of a few extra steps to reach the workplace or free coffee.",Archived,"2204 Stafford Avenue Raleigh, North Carolina",3,35.79049176,-78.66309776,https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1318723,337613,2014-10-12T21:20:38-04:00,2015-01-12T09:59:31-05:00,,2015-01-12T09:59:31-05:00

If I have to drive through the neighborhood before 7:30 I may get stuck and blocked in for 15 minutes, as I did this morning. All of these drivers were coming up Brooklyn St towards St Mary's, pulling into the parking lot on Brooklyn. Cars were parked along the street on their side of the street and no one would take turns or even yield to on coming traffic and oull over or stop. Drivers going away from St Mary's St down Brooklyn St were stuck or had to find away to turn around. Drivers were going as far as driving up on the curb into people's yards to not let other cars pass.

Jones Franklin Rd already has enough traffic & hazards on its own. I live down Wayne St and even on a good day or good time struggle with traffic issues on Jones Franklin. There are usually long lines of traffic coming from both ways with no break in traffic. Drivers are not paying attention and sometimes people have to pull out into traffic just to get out of driveways. When a huge distraction is thrown in, it makes the problem worse.
It makes it almost impossible for anyone to turn in or out of Wayne St not only due to traffic, but your line of sight is blocked by cars and people. Traffic will be backed up on both streets and people are slamming on brakes and stopping in the middle of the road to look at all the people. Its also impossible for vehicles to enter & exit Wayne st with the cars parked along both sides of the streets.

The intersection is less than 100 yards from Millbrook High School. Several affordable apartment communities are also within walking distance of this popular intersection. On a daily basis, I see pedestrians of all ages hazardously crossing from one corner to another to access the aforementioned places. Most prominently, I see adolescents crossing these intersections coming from the direction of MHS and River Birch apartments. Many of these pedestrians belong to minority racial groups. There are no crosswalks at these intersections. A few years ago, a high school student was hit by a car while trying to cross this intersection. As business continues to develop and students, workers, and community members continue to use these pathways, it is imperative that they are provided with crosswalks and sidewalks to safely cross streets.

This issue had been submitted earlier.  Lanes do not line up as one moves through the intersection and some drivers mistakenly believe they can choose any of the four lanes south of the intersection regardless of the lane they are in when entering the intersection from the north (Lead Mine Rd).  There are hash marks leading drivers through, but these are ignored. Either because drivers cannot see the faded marks or they do not understand what is going on.  This is causing other drivers to swerve out of the way of these lane changing drivers. Please do something to make this intersection safer by repainting the marks, adding reflectors/bollards and/or additional signage to instruct drivers how to move safely through the intersection.

According to the below email string, the retaining wall is not acceptable to the City of Raleigh.  I understand that all folks in government have limits to their authority.

As per the email stream below my last piece of information was that the engineer the owner talked to said the as built condition does not work and the he would be taking it down and restructuring the wall and getting permits.  He has not obtained permits nor has any other work been done.

Just got phone call from owner/contractor.  Wall will have to be taken down.
They have contacted an engineer and the as built design is not acceptable to the engineer.  Told them again a permit is required before any more work proceeds.

Good Morning Folks,

I apologize for shotgun email approach, but I wanted to make sure all who should see this email receives it.

Please see below email thread and see images attached, re: excavation & retaining wall projects at 3404 Neptune Drive, Raleigh 27604.

The excavation project has turned into a nearly completed retaining wall construction project.  I checked the City of Raleigh permit lookup page and didn't see that a permit had been applied for the retaining wall project.
Please look into this matter per what was written in below thread from June 2013.

By the way, I'm not simply curious about this project because I'm a resident of the neighborhood -- I'm also President of The Fields HOA Board and am checking because of that association.

Thanks!

See attached photos. Not so recent excavation. Looks like they should build a retaining wall. Fence is 5' from edge of hole. Left my card on front door.
We will monitor.
If they build a retaining wall it will need design and permit/inspection.
Small area disturbed. Not enough for grading/LD permit.
Met tenant on my way out. Apparently water from hill was migrating into crawlspace. Asked tenant to have owner to call me.

This wasn't a simple drip here and there, this was a steady stream of fluid. Surely the truck lost a substantial amount if oil; whether it be motor oil or hydraulic fluid. You can follow these oil trails throughout the Sawmill Rd area, tracing the truck's route. The stains are the heaviest in my immediate area [Hemlock Ct].

This is not only an eye sore, but also an environmental concern. There was rain Tuesday evening which in turn washed the standing oil into the surrounding drains. 

Myself and my neighbors hope that the department for truck maintenance is alerted of the leaking truck and it is repaired immediately. No doubt this truck is driving on other routes in Raleigh. Moreover, we would like our street treated in an environmentally safe way so that the oil is pulled up from the asphalt.

One shows 1 bus in front of the school and a line of parked cars, which prevented the second bus from pulling up in front of the school.  The second picture shows the second bus.  It is to the east of Swain St., one block away from the school.  This can't be ideal for student safety.  Additionally, there is a city bus stop on this block (E. Hargett between Swain and Monie).  The parked cars prevent the city bus from pulling up to the bus stop.  Finally, my neighbors and I have difficulty pulling out of our neighborhood (Monie Ln.), because we cannot see around the parked cars.  Today this block of Hargett St was only about half full of parked cars.  Many days the entire block is full of parked cars.  On those days, the buses can't get near the school.

This morning RPD and animal control removed an emaciated and abused dog from the property. She was starved for at least two months according to Animal Control. Criminal abuse charges are now pending against the son. The windows were open and the smell of cat feces was in the air. There is still at least one cat inside the sparsely furnished home. 

The grass is knee high and gone to seed. There are large broken limbs littered through the yard. 

An inoperable vehicle with expired tags is in the driveway with rusting tools, trash and water filled boxes scattered throughout the driveway. 

The back porch door is busted and unsecured. This allowed for the neglected dog to access the back porch.

Please note condition of house – to include vines growing up the front of the house along a window frame, facia board coverings peeled back exposing wood to the elements, and a hanging shutter.

Our HOA professional management company, HRW, Inc. has sent letters to BB&T about home maintenance.  This house is going downhill fast and needs to be addressed by the owners.  

This home is currently owned by BB&T.  The address on file for BB&T is 301 College St., Greenville, SC 29601-2014.  HRW has received no response from them to date regarding requests for corrective action.

As HOA Board President, I try and work toward maintaining and enhancing the value of homes in our development -- both for homeowners and for the community at large.  A rundown home such as this erodes homeowners' home values and contributes to eventual decline in the entire development.

Please weigh in on this matter with the enforcement capacity of the City of Raleigh to get this home cleaned up.
